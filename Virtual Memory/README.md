# Virtual-Memory

Team Members Include: Sebastian Palomo

Overview: This project is developing a virtual memory subsystem that includes virtual-to-physical address translation, page fault handling, and FIFO page replacement. The simulation models how a real OS manages memory.
Instructions: Start code with a C++ compiler.

To compile and run:
```bash
g++ -o virtual_memory virtual_memory.cpp  
./virtual_memory
