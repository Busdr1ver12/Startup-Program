# Process-Program

Team Members Include: Sebastian Palomo

Overview: This project is created to show the processes within an OS simulation. It defines the structure and behavior of a process, including states, burst time, waiting time, and other essential attributes used in scheduling.
Instructions: Start code with a C++ compiler. Include process.h in your main scheduling code.

To compile a main file that includes this header:
```bash
g++ -o scheduler main.cpp
